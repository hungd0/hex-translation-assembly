## 📄 DESCRIPTION 
A 32-bit x86 assembly program that translates a binary byte array into space-separated hexadecimal string representation. The results of the translation is generated by a subroutine and will be displayed to stdout. This project is meant to demonstrate the usage of registers, instructions, ASCII conversion, and NASM.
> Specifically, the program will take the contents from an input buffer:
```bash
inputBuf:                       
        db  0x83,0x6A,0x88,0xDE,0x9A,0xC3,0x54,0x9A
```
> and store each translated byte into an output buffer to be displayed from:
```bash
outputBuf:
        resb 80
```
> ✅ Sample Output:
```bash
83 6A 88 DE 9A C3 54 9A
```

## 📁 FILE
- hw11translate2Ascii.asm -- Source code for the assembly program

## ⚙️ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
### 🛠️ To build the project
1. Download the hw11translate2Ascii.asm then run the following instructions to compile with NASM:
```bash
nasm -f elf32 -g -F dwarf -o hw11translate2Ascii.o hw11translate2Ascii.asm
```

2. Now, link with: 
```bash
ld -m elf_i386 -o hw11translate2Ascii hw11translate2Ascii.o
```
### ▶️ To run the project
Execute the following: 
```bash
./hw11translate2Ascii
```

## 🔍 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
This program utilizes a subroutine that loops through and processes each byte in 4-bit chunks, then stores the results in the input buffer - adding a space after each byte and a newline at the end.
